      <h1>Privacy Policy for Turnix</h1>
      <p><em>Effective Date: 23 July 2025</em></p>
      <p>Thank you for playing Turnix — a pattern-matching puzzle game.</p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Turnix ("we", "our", or "us")
        collects, uses, and protects your information.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not collect personally identifiable information directly. However,
        Turnix integrates with third-party game services to support features
        like saving progress across devices.
      </p>
      <h3>a. Platform Authentication Services</h3>
      <p>We use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple Game Center</strong> (iOS)</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Games Services</strong> (Android)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These services authenticate players and provide a secure way to save
        progress across devices. When you sign in through these services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your platform-provided player ID and public profile (e.g., display
          name, avatar) may be accessed by the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not access or store any personal information beyond what is
          necessary to enable these features.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can manage your permissions through your device settings.</p>

      <h2>2. User-Generated Content (UGC) – Planned Feature</h2>
      <p>In future updates, players may be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create custom puzzles.</li>
        <li>Submit them for review.</li>
        <li>
          Have approved puzzles featured in a public "Community Puzzles"
          section.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you submit a puzzle:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your submission will not be linked to your identity unless you choose
          to include a public display name.
        </li>
        <li>
          All content must comply with our submission guidelines (to be
          published with the feature).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Rights Over Shared Patterns</h2>
      <p>
        If you submit a custom puzzle or pattern through the Community Puzzles
        feature:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You retain ownership of the content you create.</li>
        <li>
          By submitting, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
          sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, and
          distribute your pattern within the game and related promotional
          materials.
        </li>
        <li>
          This license is perpetual and allows us to showcase your submission to
          other players.
        </li>
        <li>You may not submit content you do not have the rights to share.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will not associate your real name or identity with any published
        content unless you explicitly provide a public display name.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Turnix uses Apple Game Center and Google Play Games Services only for
        authentication and cloud saves. We do not integrate any third-party
        analytics or advertising SDKs at this time.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Turnix is not directed toward children under 13, and we do not knowingly
        collect personal data from them. Parents can control Game Center and
        Play Games access through device parental controls.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        All authentication and cloud save operations are handled securely
        through platform providers. We do not store user data on our own
        servers.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any
        time. When we do, we will update the Effective Date above and notify you
        via the app or app store update notes. Continued use of Turnix after
        changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
      </p>
